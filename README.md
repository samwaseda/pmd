# Lessons learned from PMD

In this repository, I document the lessons I learned from my participation at activities from [Platform Material Digital](http://material-digital.de) and [NFDI-matwerk](http://nfdi-matwerk.de). It is mostly about dealing with people trying to implement their workflows into a common format, such as in [pyiron](https://pyiron.org).

## Table of contents

- [How to (not) write workflows](how_to_write_workflows.md)
- [Most common reasons why things fall apart](common_failures.md)

Notes:
- It's all from my very personal perspective
- The sole purpose of this documentation is to share my experience with you in the hope of giving you better understanding, but you might feel offended for what I write here. If that's the case, don't hesitate and please let me know.
