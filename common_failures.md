# Most common failures in digitalization

If you are familiar with the situation of [Platform Material Digital](https://www.material-digital.de) or [NFDI Matwerk](https://nfdi-matwerk.de), you are certainly aware of the fact that there are a lot more failures than success stories. Here I would like to document  difficulties I encountered.

## Reason I: Too complex or too simple workflow

This is by far the biggest problem, which is shared by most of the software tools. This is probably cause by the fact that for any workflow, the underlying model is so flexible that you can in principle solve so many problems that you cannot put the method into one single workflow frame. Some typical underlying models (obviously not exhaustive) are:

- Schr√∂dinger Equation
- Newton's equation of motion
- Poisson/diffusion equation
- Ginzburg-Landau equation

Now the problem is, many projects go into the following two opposite directions

- Towards a workflow that was meant to be an example, and ended up being able to do only one thing
- Towards a workflow that requires too many parameters/components for anyone to understand how to use it

So basically in the one case the workflow is too rigid, and in the other case it's too flexible.

## Reason II: Excessive purism

## Reason III: "My case is special"
